## Stuff Organizing Project

i recently faced eviction and had to urgently leave my home. you can never know for sure how much stuff you actually have. it seems like there are few clothing items, then there are books, then there is sport equipment, then there is some more clothes, then you realize that you have a locker with even bigger variety of items.â€¨when my aunt was moving from one place to another, she was always keeping a list of everything she has packed. it was a decade ago when i saw her writing everything down on paper. now i would like to create something like this in a form of a web project. a list of all the items, its location and  notes related to transportation. it can also be used as an inventory for those who do not have to change apartments yet but would love to organize things. its intended to be used by individuals for personal usage, but i imagine small companies might find this solution suitable for their storages.

the user would have to log in first to reach their list. there they can begin adding items, further edit and delete them. when adding an item they can mark which category an items falls to, where it is located, how fragile it is, and how necessary it is(how likely a person would keep it rather than throwing/giving it away).
